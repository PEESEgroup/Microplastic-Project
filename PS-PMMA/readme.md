This repository contains code exampls and four image/video datasets for microplastic assembly activity analysis.

PS-PMMA Project includes essential image datasets and code for analyzing PS-PMMA microplastic assembly patterns. Due to file size constraints, the complete image dataset is available via a separate Google Drive link. We have shown the example images in the repo. The dataset comprises 8,400 images distributed across 42 distinct classes, with 200 images per class. Each class is defined by a unique combination of four experimental conditions:

1. Concentration: 0 (control, no microplastic), 20, 200, 400, and 800 mg/L
2. Composition: PS, PS75%/PMMA25%, PS50%/PMMA50%, PS25%/PMMA75%, PMMA, and No MP
3. UV Treatment Time: 0, 3, 5, and 10 days
4. NOM Presence: Yes (NOM added) or No (no NOM)

The repository provides training code for both single-label and multi-label classification using the deepPolyNet model.

Additionally, it includes:

a. Grad-CAM++ feature importance analysis for model interpretation

b. Morphology-property feature analysis scripts, as illustrated and discussed in Figure 2 of the accompanying documentation or manuscript.
